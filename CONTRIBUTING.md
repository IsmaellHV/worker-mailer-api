## Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IsmaellHV/hono-cf.git worker-mailer-api
   cd worker-mailer-api
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables** (Workers uses `.dev.vars`):

   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
   # Edit .dev.vars with your configuration
   ```

5. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a topic branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** in logical commits
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Add or update tests** as necessary
5. **Update documentation** if needed

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```
Add email validation to user registration

- Implement email format validation
- Add comprehensive tests for email validation
- Update error messages for better user experience

Fixes #123
```

## Submitting Changes

1. **Push your changes** to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub
3. **Wait for review** - we'll review your PR as soon as possible
4. **Address feedback** if any changes are requested

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use strict TypeScript configuration

### Code Structure

- Follow the existing architecture pattern (Domain-Driven Design)
- Place business logic in the Domain layer
- Keep infrastructure concerns separate
- Use dependency injection where appropriate

### File Organization

- Use kebab-case for file names
- Group related files in directories
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Use index.ts files for clean exports

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both happy paths and error cases

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('FeatureName', () => {
  describe('when condition', () => {
    it('should do something', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = {};

      // Act
      const result = doSomething(input);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe(expected);
    });
  });
});
```
